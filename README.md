# ts-node
 A little project I made to run ts files using node. test.ts is for testing the program


# How to build from source
 Make sure you have [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) installed.

 First download the source of tsnode and run `g++ main.cpp` in cmd or pwsh.

 rename the exe to what you want the command to be. (the official command is tsnode)

 Then make a folder in the c drive and name it whatever you want.

 Put the exe in that folder

 Press the windows key and type "environment variables" and click on the top result.

 In that menu press environment variables then click PATH in system variables.

 Then click edit and then new and paste in the path to the folder you made.

 Then restart your terminal.

 Then it should be done!

# How to install normally
 Download the latest version from the releases tab and skip step 1, 2 and 3

# How to use
 Very simple.
 Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) installed and if you do run `npm install -g typescript
`
 then just go to a dir with a ts file and run what you set the exe name name as and then the name of your ts file not including the file extension

# Yes I know this has already be done
 I know there are better tools for this exact purpose out there.
 But I didn't know that when I started this project so I didnt want it to go to waste.
 EDIT: HELP I JUST FOUND OUT THERE IS ANOTHER PROJECT THAT RUNS TS CODE WITH NODE CALLED TSNODE YOU ARE KIDDING ME
